        <br></br>
        <br>my name is sophia sharifi and i am a current student at UC Berkeley
        <br> where i study computer science and cognitive science. i enjoy learning
        <br> about the intersections between tech and the human mind and i
        <br> hope to use this knowledge to build tools that best integrate into
        <br> people's lives.

        <br><br>
        <br>i became intrigued by computer science at just twelve years old,
        <br>tinkering around with the code on my tumblr page, fascinated with what
        <br> a few lines of symbols and characters could create. fast forward a
        <br> couple years, my curiousity has led me to a career in software
        <br> engineering and i am excited to keep learning more!

        <br><br>
        <br>outside of computer science, a few of my interests include exploring
        <br>the bay area, learning how to sew my own clothes, and painting!
